> Many other methods exist that aim to capture 3d data in Cultural Heritage. All have their own advantages and disadvantages compared to photogrammetry. 
Although it would be quite interesting to explore more in depth the differences between all these methods and when appropriately choose them depending on the working scenario, is out of the scope of this workshop. Nevertheless here you can find a list of some of other methods that can be used to produce 3 dimensional data from real world objects and environments.

## Laser based scanners (long, medium, short range)

There are various methods used in laser scanning (Time of flight, Phase shift, Triangulation). All of them are applied in different situations depending on the distance of an object to record and also depending on the condition of the environment. The most common method when recording long and medium range is called LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) which is applied usually when recording large landscapes or buildings. In this case the sensor on the laser calculates the time that it takes for the light of the laser to return to the sensor thus providing 3d coordinates of each recorded point.  When recording individual objects instead, short range scanners are more used applying triangulation techniques which return to the sensor in a specific location.

## Structured light scanners 
This method uses a more affordable way of recording 3d object by projecting a pattern onto the object. The canera(S) will record the distorted pattern on a non-flat surface thus determing the 3d shape of the oject.

## Arm-based scanners
This types of scanner are manually operated by tracing the object for digitization. They are quite time consuming and deployed when a very precise digitization is required, such as small fragments of pottery and other small objects.

## MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
This type of scanning records the exterior and the interior of an object and is used mostly in medicine to record  or full body or body parts, however it can also be used to record pottery if volumetric data are required.

## (3d)CT (3d Computed Tomography) 
This method uses Xray in order to cupture volumetric data trough slides the software then reconstruct the 3d model by assembling all the slides together.

## Digital Acquisition trough 3d software
Another recent interesting techniques comes from the blending of photogrammetry and 360 footage.
In the video below we can it is explained how from 360 footgae we can extract 3d information of the content of the footage.

## (3d)Ultrasound 
This method is used in medicine to record vessels or human fetus. When recorded over time it is referred as 4d ultrasound with three spatial dimension and one time dimension.
